# HalalCheck-website-django
A website that provides a list of suspicious and nonproducts, components, and restaurants.

This website was created for the project. The main idea was to enable fast product checking by adding a QR scanner. However, in the process, I realized that creating and adding a scanner function on the website would take much of time. So like fundament for the website I created HTML/CSS frontend and back with the sqlite3 database created on Django in 3 weeks.

running process:
cd app
cd blogengine
cd app1
python.py sunserrver

P.S. Some pictures of the product are not that necessary.
